- # Rebuilding some basic enumerable methods in Ruby 

- The Enumerable module provides a collection of methods that get "mixed in", or included, with other classes like Array and Hash. The class must provide a method each, which yields successive members of the collection.

The task is to rebuild the methods, list of method rebuilt as follows:
- `my_each`
- `my_each_with_index`
- `my_select`
- `my_all`
- `my_map`
- `my_any`
- `my_none`
- `my_count`
- `my_inject`

```ruby
  p [3, 4, 6, 9].my_each_with_index { |x, i| p "we have index of #{i} for case #{x}"}
  =>  "we have index of 0 for case 3"
      "we have index of 1 for case 4"
      "we have index of 2 for case 6"
      "we have index of 3 for case 9"
      [3, 4, 6, 9]
```
